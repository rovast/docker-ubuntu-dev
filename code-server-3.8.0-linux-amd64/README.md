## Highlights

- Code on any device with a consistent development environment
- Use cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more
- Preserve battery life when you're on the go; all intensive tasks run on your server

## Getting Started

There are two ways to get started:

1. Using the [install script](./install.sh), which automates most of the process. The script uses the system package manager (if possible)
2. Manually installing code-server; see [Installation](./doc/install.md) for instructions applicable to most use cases

If you choose to use the install script, you can preview what occurs during the install process:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
```

To install, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

When done, the install script prints out instructions for running and starting code-server.

We also have an in-depth [setup and configuration](./doc/guide.md) guide.

### Cloud Program ☁️

We're working on a cloud platform that makes deploying and managing code-server easier.
Consider running code-server with the beta flag `--link` if you don't want to worry about

- TLS
- Authentication
- Port Forwarding

```bash
$ code-server --link
Proxying code-server to Coder Cloud, you can access your IDE at https://valmar-jon.cdr.co
```
